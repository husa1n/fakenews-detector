      "beijingtokyo reuters hillary clinton put donald trump on the defensive and showed a better grasp of foreign policy issues according to a sampling of people across asia who watched the fiery first us presidential debate in china the debate was streamed live on china’s twitterlike weibo service and attracted thousands of comments despite the lack of a translation into chinese some called trump “a loose cannon” while others thought that as a businessman he was best qualified to lead the world’s largest economy william hua a chinese lawyer who watched the debate at an american chamber of commerce event in beijing said he thought clinton came out on top he was most concerned though about an issue that didn’t come up in the debate “donald trump says japan and south korea can develop nuclear weapons it seems absolutely ridiculous” hua said trump said in an interview with the new york times in march he would consider letting japan and south korea build their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on america for protection against north korea opinion polls have shown the two candidates in a tight race leading up to the debate a cnn poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62 percent felt clinton won compared to 27 percent for trump in a sign investors also saw clinton as the winner us sp500 stock futures rose as did asian shares “markets started to call the debate for hillary within the first 15 minutes or so with the mexican peso surging in what is probably its busiest asian session in years” said sean callow a senior currency analyst at westpac in sydney the mexican currency has risen and fallen in recent weeks depending on polling numbers for trump who has vowed to take trade protectionist measure against the united states’ southern neighbor and build a wall across the us border with mexico to prevent illegal immigration trump raised eyebrows among a packed crowd watching the debate at the american club in singapore when he lashed out against china “look at what china is doing to our country” trump said not long after the debate began “they are devaluing their currency and we have nobody in our government to fight them they are using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild china and many other countries are doing the same thing” landy eng a former employee of the california state government who’s been living in singapore the past 20 years said he was an undecided voter “but trump’s chinabashing is something i’m not particularly in favor of” he said still eng said he does like the “disruptive” factor of trump’s campaign and thinks it is making clinton a better candidate aloysius lee a 65yearold retiree from hong kong who watched the debate at the foreign correspondents’ club in the territory said that trump was too unpredictable “hillary is the kind of person you can do business with at least from my point of view” lee said with trump “you don’t know what’s going to happen next you don’t know what he’s going to say next” south koreans watching the debate on tv screens in the lobby of seoul’s central train station said they were with clinton on the issues “trump has ideas of withdrawing us forces from our country and in terms of national security trump is a threatening figure” said lee hyojin 26 “so i support hillary” she said trump during the debate again said if us allies like japan and south korea “don’t pay their fair share they may have to defend themselves or help us out” asked about trump’s comment japan’s defence minister tomomi inada told a regularly scheduled news conference on tuesday the usjapan military alliance does not just benefit japan “but is also in the interests of the united states” clinton seemed to have the better temperament during the debate according to some asian viewers li jiaoli 21 an editing intern from china’s southwestern province of sichuan said clinton seemed more presidential while trump’s expressions made her laugh “trump’s responses were too aggressive highlevel politicians should have more selfcontrol” li said the debate prompted a storm of tweets around the region many of them commenting on the optics of the debate “trump is looking worked up and angry and sulky and shouty she looks utterly in control by contrast” said barkha dutt news anchor on india’s ndtv in a tweet “she ignores his barbs attacks he gets baited by every one of hers” mel fryer 30 a waitress at the mercantile hotel in sydney’s historic rocks district said she was “terrified” at the prospect of a trump presidency while the debate screened to an empty pub “but he’s going ok” she said of his debate performance “he uses simple words and simple phrases and gets his point across”\n",

      "washington reuters president donald trump signed a temporary order on thursday to keep the us embassy in israel in tel aviv instead of relocating it to jerusalem despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move after months of fierce debate within his administration trump chose to continue his predecessors’ policy of signing a sixmonth waiver overriding a 1995 law requiring that the embassy be transferred to jerusalem an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart israelipalestinian peace talks the white house insisted however that the decision which is sure to disappoint israel’s us supporters did not mean trump was abandoning the goal of eventually shifting the embassy to jerusalem but a us official said no timetable has been set “the question is not if that move happens but only when” the white house said in a statement with a deadline looming trump made the decision to defer action on the embassy “to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between israel and the palestinians fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend america’s national security interests” the white house said palestinian leaders arab governments and western allies had urged trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation which would have upended decades of us policy by granting what would have been seen as de facto us recognition of israel’s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital “though israel is disappointed that the embassy will not move at this time we appreciate today’s expression of president trump’s friendship to israel and his commitment to moving the embassy in the future” israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu’s office said in a statement taking a harder stance israeli education minister naftali bennett a farright member of netanyahu’s coalition said delaying the move would “damage the prospect of a lasting peace by nurturing false expectations among the palestinians regarding the division of jerusalem which will never happen” nabil abu rdainah a close aide to palestinian president mahmoud abbas said trump’s decision “reaffirms the seriousness of the united states in its efforts to achieve peace” trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to israel and the west bank in may despite that most experts are skeptical of trump’s chances for achieving a peace deal that had eluded other us presidents the status of jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks israel captured arab east jerusalem during the 1967 middle east war and later annexed it a move not recognized internationally israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state jerusalem is home to sites considered holy by the jewish muslim and christian religions successive us administrations have insisted that jerusalem’s status must be decided in negotiations on the campaign trail trump’s proisrael rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy but after he took office in january the issue lost momentum as he met arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate longstalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator some of trump’s top aides pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy the proisrael rightwing base that helped him win the presidency the state department however recommended against an embassy move one us official said “no one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the president’s strong support for israel” according to the white house statement on the signing of the waiver\n",
